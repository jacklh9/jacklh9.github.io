<h2>2016/02/29: On Building A Personal Website</h2>

<p>
  <span class="drop-cap">T</span>oday's assignment is to write a brief blog post on the experiences of building a personal website.
</p>

<p>
  One of our first assignments was to create a wireframe. I know that
  the wireframe helped me tremendously to focus on what I wanted from
  an ideal standpoint. I had no idea if I was going to be able to pull
  it off, but I liked that I could brain-storm on what I wished the
  site might look like without actually worrying about how to pull it
  off--you just laid it all out on virtual paper with wireframe
  software. You can see the wireframes I used for this site in my
  Projects link. I think I came pretty close to my original concept.
</p>

<p>
  The second concern of mine was the fact that I'm color-blind. Not
  gray-scale color-blind, mind you--I <i>do</i> in fact see colors,
  but some appear washed out and are hard to distinguish, such as
  reds, browns, greens or yellows, greens, or grays and
  aqua-marines. I know this kept me from ever considering web design
  in the past, and therefore focused on back-end development. I was
  happy to see that one solution was to use websites that took
  pictures and figured out color palletes from them. I used one for
  this very site and was extremely happy with the results, even
  getting some good feedback about the color scheme. Huzzah for
  technology helping us overcome our disabilities!!!
</p>
<p>
  The next hurdle I encountered was CSS. I do find CSS rather
  confusing, but I've been quite happy with SOME of the results of the
  CSS formatting on this website, but I do know I have lots more to
  learn.
</p>
<p>
  Then there's the challenge of desktop/laptop versus
  mobile/tablet-focused web design. The website currently doesn't
  scale well horizontally on a PC which has plenty of wide
  real-estate. I need to add some additional work to make it expand to
  the full availability of the screen. I liked the way the page looked
  on mobile, but then not on a tablet which has lots of verticle
  space. Then there was the issue I saw in my "Cheat Sheet" project
  which was that the scrolling on a mobile device was a PAIN in that
  particular page because a mobile/tablet device doesn't get the same
  scroll bars (or use of a mouse wheel), like on a desktop. Long story
  short--I need to work on mobile vs desktop design and will be one of
  my focuses in the coming weeks while at Dev Bootcamp.

  Well, until next time. -- JLH
