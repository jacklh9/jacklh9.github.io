Reflection for 2.7 

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was a very fruitful experience. It was good to compare the different approaches and applications used for wireframing. It was also helpful having the second set of eyes to interpret the assignment.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, wireframing was extremely helpful in helping visualize. The wireframing from the previous lessons tremendously cut down on the amount of time it took to complete this assignment.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We both agreed that a good wireframe helps you visualize. We both differed in approaches. My partner used a more generic approach versus me using the wireframe to get very specific with the layout onto a grid. He helped me realize that eventually we'll be learning about responsive design and flow which will make using a grid moot.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I was already well-versed in semantic elements from the previous lessons, but my partner reminded me of the "<article>" tag which was very useful. He also used the "<address>" tag which I had not heard of.
