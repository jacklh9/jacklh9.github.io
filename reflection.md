###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that the element content area is buffed by an outer layer of "padding", followed by "border" and then "margin". Initially padding and border are set to 0. If those three elements exist, their width must be added to the content width for the total width of the element. Margin also is the only one of the three that can be negative.

###What did you learn about CSS positioning?

There are multiple ways to position elements: static (normal flow), relative, absolute, fixed and using z-indexes.

###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The header, footer, side bars and main body were easiest to arrange. Most difficult was trying to figure out how text and images flow within the container (body).


###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

It's fun but EXTREMELY challenging.
