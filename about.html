<h2>About</h2>

<p>
<span class="drop-cap">M</span>y name is Jack and I’m a technologist. My eyes were opened to the world of technology when a forward-thinking elementary school teacher piloted a program to introduce 3rd graders to the world of programming by teaching them Logo on then newly acquired Apple IIe computers. In my 5th grade, my uncle, an I.T. field support technician for Congress met with me for the first time while visiting his sister, my mother, after a 25 year separation after their parents’ divorce and gifted me an IBM 8086 PC Jr with GW-BASIC and Que DOS programming manuals. And a year later, a very prescient school teacher thought it worthwhile that every 6th grader leave elementary school with the ability to touch-type on a QWERTY keyboard. I don’t know if they ever understood just how far reaching their ripples went after their small stone-throws into the lake of learning, but I am ever grateful they had the instinct or foresight to embrace technology, because their small acts have had profound effects on my life. I am writing because I am looking for companies with a similar mindset—embracing technology as an asset for betterment; looking to marry their employees’ fervor for technology with the company’s vision to change the world.
</p>

<p>
I am not proselytizing technology for the sake of technology. Rather, I am pointing out the missed opportunities that arise from companies that fail to understand technology and the employees that utilize them. For example, I am saddened by the employer who seems to have an inherent mistrust of their employees, threatened by their skills-set, the tools of their trade and the skunk-works projects they produce, writing both the employee and the project off as a security threat. I am dumbfounded by constant management purchase practices based on the naïve notion that any problem can be fixed with off-the-shelf turnkey products without any kind of customization by the vendor or employees. I cringe when a manager requests a new procedure involving people repeating a menial task over-and-over again, day-after-day, holiday-after-holiday failing to realize the inevitable outcome that comes from fatigue, forgetfulness or ordinary employee turn-over that ultimately results in the break-down of the process—it’s only a matter of time. My mantra is automation, automation, automation. Automation frees up people to do what really makes a company excel: continue thinking, designing and creating. Leave the repetitive tasks to computers—by their very nature, they will excel at it and inherently document the process through their code and design.
</p>

<p>
I’ve touched many technologies over the years, in various projects and situations. Each one has a story behind them, a problem that ultimately had a solution, some simple and mundane, others more noteworthy. As a result, I've become platform and language agnostic. I recognize that different systems have their strengths in certain circumtances and to rule out any, out of a platform religious zeal is shortsided and sophomoric. I believe in the right tool for the right job and setting--or in knowing there’s more than one way to skin a cat. Sometimes there's a need to use  widespread, well-understood, industry-standard vendor proprietary software; othertimes, it's wise to make use of the plethora of Open-Source software and APIs made available to the world. As such, I try to delve into as many technologies as possible, from Windows to Linux to OSX, from Android to iOS. Variety, after-all, is the spice of life.

Yours truly,
