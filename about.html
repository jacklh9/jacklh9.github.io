<h2>About</h2>

<p>
<span class="drop-cap">H</span>ello. My name is Jack, and I’m a
technologist. I am interested in software development on a variety of
platforms in support of process automation, reporting, monitoring and
alerting, dashboards, etcetera. I have over two decades of hands-on
experience in I.T. that began in pc repair and tech support and
continued in my career in systems and application administration and
back-end programming. I’ve touched many technologies over the years,
in various projects and situations. Each one had a unique story behind
them, some simple and mundane solutions, and others more
noteworthy. As a result, my experiences have left me platform and
language agnostic. I recognize that different systems have their
strengths in certain circumtances and to rule out any, out of a
platform religious zeal is shortsided and sophomoric. I believe in the
right tool for the right job and setting, knowing there’s more than
one way to skin a cat. Sometimes there's a need to use widespread,
well-understood, industry-standard vendor proprietary software;
othertimes, it's wise to make use of the plethora of Open-Source
software and APIs made available to the world. As such, I try to delve
into as many technologies as possible, from Windows to Linux to OSX,
and Android to iOS. Variety, after-all, is the spice of life.
